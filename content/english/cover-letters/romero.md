<hr class="my-4">

I'm a {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "Gameplay Programmer" >}} with more than {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "5 years" >}} of experience working on {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "AAA and AA multiplayer FPS games, in UE4 and UE5." >}}  
I like to think of myself as a very technical programmer with strong soft skills and an excellent understanding of the general process of making a good game. Very passional FPS player.

I'm very excited about the possibility of working in a brand new FPS with the mark of John Romero.

I've worked on two FPS titles in UE4/5, one released AA Multiplayer FPS and one AAA Multiplayer FPS game still under development, which was the first "greenfield" project I was part of.
My experience working in FPS games includes but is not limited to:

    - Implementation of GAS. (Greenfield project)
    - Implementation of Asset Manager System. (Greenfield project)
    - UI (Common UI, 3rd party and customs solutions).
    - Experience using WWise.
    - Interaction Systems.
    - Inventory systems.
    - Custom locomotion states (CMC)
    - Replicated Locomotion flags setup.
    - Procedural Recoil and Weapon Animations.
    - Damage Systems.

I'm very interested in joining {{< param studio >}} as an {{< param role >}}, I think I would make a great fit for the position, and working on such an exciting project and studio would be an invaluable position to keep developing my programming skills working in my favorite genre of video games.

I also expect to find in {{< param studio >}} an opportunity to develop my mentoring abilities and keep forming my career in the long term.

I'm ready to jump right into the action and be valuable in whatever state the project is.
