<hr class="my-4">

I'm a {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "Gameplay Programmer" >}} with more than {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "5 years" >}} of experience working on {{< text class="font-bold text-portal-orange" text= "AAA and AA multiplayer FPS games, in UE4 and UE5." >}}  
I like to think of myself as a very technical programmer with strong communication and soft skills and complete understanding of the process of making a good game. Very passional FPS player.

I'm very excited about the possibility of working in {{< param studio >}} in a team where my previous experience working with designers and content creators can be useful.

I've worked on two FPS titles in UE4/5, one released AA Multiplayer FPS and one AAA Multiplayer FPS game still under development, which was the first "greenfield" project I was part of.
My experience working in games includes but is not limited to:

    - Implementation of GAS.
    - Implementation of Asset Manager System.
    - UI (Common UI, 3rd party and customs solutions).
    - Experience using WWise.
    - Interaction Systems.
    - Inventory systems.
    - Custom locomotion states (CMC)
    - Replicated Locomotion flags setup.
    - Procedural Recoil and Weapon Animations.
    - Damage Systems.

I'm very interested in joining {{< param studio >}} as an {{< param role >}}, I think I would make a great fit for the position due to my love for diverse teams and working along designers and content creators. Working on such an exciting studio would be an invaluable oportunity to keep developing my programming skills while working with a diverse team.

I look forward to finding long-term career development opportunities at {{< param studio >}} to enhance my programming skills as well as my mentoring skills and continue my growth.

I'm ready to jump right into the action!
